# Focus Check — CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

A Swift Playgrounds app (`.swiftpm`) that imports a photo and renders
focus-analysis overlays on top of it. Beyond the original sharpness-peaking
idea, the app has grown into a general image-inspection tool: classical
sharpness + ML depth + motion-blur detection, on-device sensitive-content
classification, silhouette-aware mosaic redaction, EXIF badges, 2× zoom,
press-and-hold compare, and PNG export via the share sheet.

Target platforms: **iPadOS 18.1+** and **macOS 14+** (single codebase, UIKit
everywhere — the product type is `.iOSApplication`, so Mac runs via
*Designed for iPad*).

Distribution paths (sibling projects):
- `FocusApp.swiftpm/` — Swift Playgrounds on iPad / Mac. Unsigned, local.
- `Xcode/` — XcodeGen manifest → `.xcodeproj`. Same sources; signed builds
  for TestFlight / App Store + the `SensitiveContentAnalysis` capability.

## Architecture

### Package format
- Swift Package Manager project (`.swiftpm`)
- Product type: `.iOSApplication` (UIKit view system, iPad + Mac)
- Swift language mode: 5.9 (Playgrounds default)
- Round-trips with Xcode 16+ via the sibling XcodeGen project for
  debugging, Metal Frame Capture, and Instruments

### Dependency
- [`ZIPFoundation`](https://github.com/weichsel/ZIPFoundation) —
  pure-Swift unzip, used by `ModelArchiveInstaller` to unpack Core ML
  model archives downloaded at runtime.

### Capabilities (declared in `Package.swift`)
- `.photoLibrary` — select originals from Photos via `PHPickerViewController`
- `.fileAccess(.userSelectedFiles, .readOnly)` — `.fileImporter` path
- `.outgoingNetworkConnections` — required on macOS sandbox for the
  runtime model downloads

## Core technical stack

### Sharpness detection (classical path)
- Pipeline: `MPSImageGaussianBlur` (σ ≈ 1) → `MPSImageLaplacian` →
  `MPSImageMedian` (3×3, drops shadow-noise false positives)
- Compute at **1024 px long-side** analysis resolution (`LaplacianVariance.analysisLongSide`);
  upscale to source extent with `CILanczosScaleTransform`
- Output: single-channel `r16Float` `MTLTexture`, cached across slider scrub

### Depth estimation (ML path, optional)
- Model: `apple/coreml-depth-anything-v2-small` (F16, ~50 MB, ANE-friendly)
- **Runtime download**, not bundled. `ModelArchiveInstaller(.depthAnything)`
  fetches a zipped `.mlmodelc` from a GitHub release and installs it into
  `Application Support/`. The 50 MB directory-format artifact can't sit in
  the git repo and can't be compiled on iPad.
- Loaded via generic `MLModel` + `MLDictionaryFeatureProvider` (no
  auto-generated Swift class — SPM can't process `.mlpackage`)
- Input size is **queried from the model's image constraint** at load
  time (pick the largest enumerated size); don't hardcode 518×518
- Stretched (non-uniform) to model input — preserves source↔map
  spatial correspondence for the post-inference upscale

### Motion-blur detection
- Frequency-domain: 2D Accelerate FFT; motion PSF produces a directional
  dark band in the spectrum, defocus produces rings
- **Global reading** for the info badge: center-cropped 256² patch,
  ~10 ms on A14
- **Tiled confidence map** for the `.motion` overlay: 512² analysis
  image, 128² patches, 64-stride → 7×7 grid, ~100 ms total
- Badge floor: `confidence > 0.4` (`MotionBlurReport.isSignificant`) —
  keeps fences / waves / stripes from consistently triggering it; the
  overlay shows sub-threshold readings too so the user can inspect them

### Sensitive-content classification
Two backends stacked in `SensitiveContentChecker`:

1. **Primary: Apple's `SensitiveContentAnalysis` framework** — requires
   the SCA capability + user-enabled Communication Safety (iOS) or
   per-app Sensitive Content Warning (macOS). In Playgrounds /
   unsigned builds this reliably returns `.disabled`.
2. **Fallback: runtime-downloaded Core ML model** — lovoo/NSFWDetector
   CreateML-trained binary SFW/NSFW classifier, installed via
   `ModelArchiveInstaller(.nsfw)`.

The availability enum surfaces both paths plus "neither" so the UI can
show a targeted install prompt rather than silently hiding the feature.

### Vision-derived regions
Run in one consolidated `VNImageRequestHandler.perform([...])` pass so the
CGImage decode and internal pyramid are shared:

- `VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequest` — face rects + eye-bar geometry
- `VNDetectHumanRectanglesRequest` — body bounding boxes
- `VNDetectHumanBodyPoseRequest` — 2D joints (derive groin + chest rects)
- `VNDetectHumanBodyPose3DRequest` — 3D hips for sideways-pose widening
- `VNGeneratePersonSegmentationRequest` (`.balanced`) — silhouette mask
  for the `.body` mosaic mode

### Overlay rendering
- `MTKView` via `UIViewRepresentable` (UIKit-only — product type is
  `.iOSApplication`; no `NSViewRepresentable` branch exists or is correct)
- `framebufferOnly = false`, `autoResizeDrawable = true`, paused off
- `CIContext(mtlDevice:)` shared across analyzer + renderer; never
  rasterize to `CGImage` mid-pipeline except at export and Vision decode
- Working color space: **extended linear Display P3**,
  working format: `RGBAh`, `cacheIntermediates = false`
- Drawable: `rgba16Float` on the `CAMetalLayer`,
  `wantsExtendedDynamicRangeContent = true` for EDR

### Overlay styles (`OverlayStyle`)
| Style | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `None` | Original image — disables the threshold slider + analysis mode |
| `Peaking` | Colored edges gated by the focus mask (FastRawViewer-style) |
| `Mask` | Flat 50%-opacity tint over in-focus pixels |
| `Heatmap` | Viridis LUT via `CIColorCube` (never jet) |
| `Error` | Red = too close / blue = too far, relative to focal plane; requires Hybrid mode |
| `Motion` | Tint where the per-patch motion-blur confidence exceeds the threshold |

### Mosaic modes (`MosaicMode`)
| Mode | Coverage |
|---|---|
| `Tabloid` | Eyes (black bar) + Groin (pixelate) |
| `Eyes` | Rotated black bar following head tilt |
| `Face` | Pixelate face landmark rect |
| `Chest` | Pixelate upper torso rect from pose joints |
| `Groin` | Pixelate pelvis rect; widens up to 3× for sideways bodies |
| `Body` | Pixelate along the person silhouette, snapped to the pixelation grid so the edge reads block-jagged |
| `Whole` | Pixelate the entire image |

Triggers: classifier flagged **and** the Mosaic toggle is on, **or**
`Force Censor` is on (bypasses the classifier). Both paths are honored
by the live renderer and the PNG export.

## Key implementation rules

### Threading
- `FocusAnalyzer` is an actor; MPS kernels, `CIContext`, `MLModel`
  calls all stay on it
- Analysis runs on `Task.detached(priority: .userInitiated)`; cancel
  the prior task on each new image load / mode change
- Slider scrub must **not** re-analyze — the renderer reads
  `@Published var threshold: Float` directly each frame
- Live MTKView resize (Stage Manager): only notify the renderer when
  drawable size delta > 1 px

### Memory
- Treat everything as `CIImage` (lazy recipe graph); never materialize
  `CGImage` mid-pipeline
- 50 MP RAW → fp16 ≈ 400 MB; needs the
  `com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-memory-limit` entitlement on
  8 GB iPads (signed Xcode builds only — Playgrounds can't declare it)

### Core ML in SwiftPM
- SwiftPM **cannot compile** `.mlpackage` / `.mlmodel` — artifacts must
  already be `.mlmodelc` when the app sees them. We solve this by
  downloading zipped `.mlmodelc` directories at runtime; nothing Core-ML
  needs to live in the repo.
- No auto-generated Swift class — load with `MLModel(contentsOf:)`,
  feed `MLDictionaryFeatureProvider`, iterate `featureNames` at output

### Metal shaders
- No custom `.metal` files — SwiftPM doesn't compile them. Rely on
  MPS kernels + Core Image built-in filters throughout.

### Color management
- RAW via `CIRAWFilter(imageURL:)` — don't bypass it
- `CIImage(contentsOf:)` with `.applyOrientationProperty: true` so EXIF
  orientation is normalized before any transform runs
- Working color space `extendedLinearDisplayP3`, working format `RGBAh`
- PNG export: render in linear P3, then `createCGImage` to `sRGB` for the
  file — downstream viewers overwhelmingly expect sRGB PNGs

## Platform notes

| Concern | iPad (`.iOSApplication`) | Mac (Designed for iPad) |
|---|---|---|
| View bridge | `UIViewRepresentable` | Same (UIKit via Catalyst-style) |
| File import | PHPicker + `.fileImporter` | `.fileImporter` (PHPicker also works) |
| SCA primary backend | Enabled via Screen Time → Comm Safety | Enabled via Settings → Sensitive Content Warning (per-app; requires capability + signing) |
| Pencil Pro | `.onPencilSqueeze` cycles Peaking ↔ Heatmap | N/A |
| Network egress | Default-allow | Needs `.outgoingNetworkConnections()` capability + `com.apple.security.network.client` in entitlements |

---

## File input

**Primary (Photos):** `PHPickerViewController` wrapped via
`UIViewControllerRepresentable` in `ImageImporter.swift`. Runs
out-of-process — no Photos permission dialog. `suggestedName` carries
the original camera filename, which SwiftUI's `PhotosPicker` doesn't
surface. `preferredAssetRepresentationMode = .current` preserves
ProRAW / RAW / HEIC originals.

**UTI fallback order** (empty / unexpected UTIs): `public.camera-raw-image`
→ `com.adobe.raw-image` → `public.heic` → `public.image`.

**Secondary (Files / disk):** `.fileImporter(allowedContentTypes: [.image, .rawImage])`.
Security-scoped URLs — call `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()`
but read via `Data(contentsOf:)` regardless (`copyItem` is flakier
inside the macOS sandbox).

**Drag and drop:** `.dropDestination(for: URL.self)` on the empty-state
placeholder view.

---

## Export

`FocusViewModel.exportPNG()` snapshots the current state into a
`FocusCompositeInputs`, feeds it through the same `FocusRenderer.composite`
used by the live MTKView (at source resolution, zoom = 1), encodes sRGB
PNG via `CGImageDestination`, and writes to `FileManager.temporaryDirectory`.
`ContentView` presents the URL through a `UIActivityViewController`
(`ShareSheet`) so the user can save to Files, Photos, or any registered
share target.

Force Censor participates in the export: the mosaic condition is
`forceCensor || ((isSensitive == true) && mosaicEnabled)` in both the
live renderer and the export path, so the exported image always matches
what's on screen.

---

## Runtime model installs

Both installs use the same code path — `ModelArchiveInstaller` +
`ModelArchive` descriptor:

```swift
struct ModelArchive {
    let directoryName: String   // e.g. "DepthAnythingV2SmallF16.mlmodelc"
    let sourceURL: URL          // GitHub release asset (.zip)
    func installedURL() throws -> URL
    func isInstalled() -> Bool
}
```

- `ModelArchive.depthAnything` → `depth-model-v1` release tag
- `ModelArchive.nsfw` → `nsfw-model-v1` release tag

Maintainer workflow (one-time, requires a Mac):

```bash
# Depth Anything v2 Small F16
xcrun coremlcompiler compile DepthAnythingV2SmallF16.mlpackage /tmp/
ditto -c -k --sequesterRsrc --keepParent \
      /tmp/DepthAnythingV2SmallF16.mlmodelc \
      DepthAnythingV2SmallF16.mlmodelc.zip
gh release upload depth-model-v1 DepthAnythingV2SmallF16.mlmodelc.zip

# NSFW fallback (lovoo)
curl -L -o NSFW.mlmodel \
  https://github.com/lovoo/NSFWDetector/releases/download/1.1.0/NSFW.mlmodel
xcrun coremlcompiler compile NSFW.mlmodel /tmp/
ditto -c -k --sequesterRsrc --keepParent /tmp/NSFW.mlmodelc NSFW.mlmodelc.zip
gh release upload nsfw-model-v1 NSFW.mlmodelc.zip
```

`OverlayControls` renders a dedicated install/progress/retry row for
each, gated by the analyzer's availability flags.

## Known limitations & non-goals

- No custom `.metal` authoring in Playgrounds — MPS / Core Image only
- No debugger breakpoints in Playgrounds — open `Xcode/FocusApp.xcodeproj`
  for Metal Frame Capture, Instruments, and source-level debugging
- **Motion blur** from the FFT path isn't perfectly distinguishable from
  strong directional texture; the 0.4 confidence floor tamps most false
  positives but not all
- **Smooth in-focus regions** (skin, sky) underread in the Laplacian
  path; Hybrid with Depth Anything recovers them
- Vision has **no spatial focus-map API** — all focus detection is custom
- `CIRAWFilter` supports Apple's [published camera list](https://support.apple.com/en-us/122870)
  only; cameras outside it would need LibRaw
- **SCA in Playgrounds** will always be `.disabled` — the NSFW fallback
  download is the only way sensitive-content flagging works in
  unsigned builds
- **No demographic inference** (gender, age, ethnicity) — Vision doesn't
  expose these and we're not shipping a third-party classifier for them
